 I am a Data Scientist based in Indiana. I completed my undergrad in Computer Science from [Ball State University](https://www.bsu.edu/academics/collegesanddepartments/computer-science) and my masters in Data Science from [Indiana University](https://datascience.indiana.edu/index.html). My personal research is on quantitative finance, or mathematical modeling of financial markets. Previously I was a Data Analysis/Data Scientist at Reserve Trust.
