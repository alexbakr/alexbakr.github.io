 I am a graduate student at Indiana University Bloomington. I completed my undergrad in Computer Science from [Ball State University](https://www.bsu.edu/academics/collegesanddepartments/computer-science). My personal research is on quantitative finance, or mathematical modeling of financial markets. Previously I was a Data Analysis and Strategic Pricing Coordinator at Seyfarth Shaw.
